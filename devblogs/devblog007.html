        <h3 class="section_title">Teslov's Secret Notes</h3><br>

        <h2 class="section_name change">Weapon System 2.0</h2><br>
        <p class="section_text">For long time weapons were nothing more than meshes attached to player models. If weapon needed some additional data ( like special abilities ) it was handled by another object that spawned on runtime. It was of course terrible and hard to manage.
          I was probably drunk when I thought of it. Anyway, it got reworked and all the data about your weapon is stored in your weapon. This allows us to make unique items a lot more easily.</p>

        <h2 class="section_name change">Building System</h2><br>
        <p class="section_text">Building system is currently pretty simple. Grab a hammer, element template will show up. Press right click to change selected piece or press left click to build it. Every part cost 100 wood for now, it'll of course change in the future.<br><em>Fun Fact: Building was implemented before inventory API was a thing so it was impossible to manipulate it easily ( it is now, thankfully )</em></p>

        <h2 class="section_name addition">Magic System</h2><br>
        <p class="section_text">This one is my favourited. Magic is handled like weapons but exists only temporary as it's not stored in inventory. It is instead stored in array of available spells. This way you can learn spells or you can cast them with another item like scroll
          or rune.<br>There's also spellbook widget where you can browse your spells.</p>

        <h2 class="section_name addition">Consumables</h2><br>
        <p class="section_text">Another thing added, items you can use from your inventory. It includes things like bread, water, potions or magical scrolls. System is very extendable and can be easily used to make any kind of item as every item can have it's own script.</p>

        <h2 class="section_name addition">Containers</h2><br>
        <p class="section_text">Inventory system got moved to external component and got it's own API. Now it's a lot easier to manipulate backpack so I've added containers.<br>Lootable things can now be plundered with special quick-loot interface a little bit based on certain
          FPS game with RPG elements that took place in wastelands.</p>

        <h2 class="section_name change">Animation Tweaks</h2><br>
        <p class="section_text">Items now have <span style="color: green">Type</span> which dictates what animation does it use. All anims are now nicely blended and show on both first and third person</p>

        <h2 class="section_name addition">Factions</h2><br>
        <p class="section_text">Factions allow AI to understand who's an enemy and who's a friend. Faction include things like "undead" or "predator" and allow for things like making Wolves attack Deer. System is of course runtime-editable and includes players as they can also
          join one of four major factions.</p>

        <h2 class="section_name change">Harvestables Rework</h2><br>
        <p class="section_text">For testing purposes, at the beginning of the project we used simple actors for gatherable resources. This way was pretty bad because it's both performance unfriendly and make map-making a very boring task. <br>I've rewrote the system to use foliage
          with custom instanced mesh solution that allows for replication. <br>( Foliage is not able to be replicated in UE4 by default )</p>

        <h2 class="section_name addition">Hunger/Thirst</h2>
        <h2 onmouseout="removeMemberRole(this)" onmouseover="displayMemberRole(this)" class="username">KeZeio</h2>
        <h2 class="userrole programmer">Programmer</h2><br>
        <p class="section_text">KeZeio added Hunger and Thirst system to the game, they don't impact gameplay too much yet.</p>

        <h2 class="section_name addition">Small stuff</h2><br>
        <p class="section_text">Alongside big stuff I've put above there also were lots of fixes, new meshes, optimization, new items. I've started working on NPCs, quests and dialogues, made working prototype of randomly generated dungeons, meshes for humans with better IK
          to speed up animation process. There were also some work on mounts. We're all very busy here with lots and lots of new juicy content coming.</p>
